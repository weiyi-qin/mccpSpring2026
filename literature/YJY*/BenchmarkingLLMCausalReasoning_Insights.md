## Section-by-Section Macro Analysis

### Section 1: Introduction (CARS Model Application)

#### Move 1: Establishing Territory (Paragraphs 1-2)
**Content**: Claims centrality of causal reasoning for LLMs in high-stakes applications
**Strengths**:
- Uses evaluative language: "fundamental," "high-stakes applications," "robust multi-hop reasoning"
- Establishes broad significance across multiple domains
- Present/present perfect tense: "have driven," "have begun to probe," "enables"

**Excerpt**: "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in a wide range of high-stakes applications. Motivated by the promise that LLMs' causal reasoning could enable robust multi-hop reasoning and complex problem-solving, researchers have begun to probe these models beyond surface-level pattern matching (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023). Unlike surface-level pattern recognition, causal reasoning enables a model to understand cause-and-effect relationships, moving beyond mere statistical correlations (Pearl, 2009; Spirtes et al., 2000)."

**Analysis**: Strong centrality claims supported by practical applications. Notice interdisciplinary appeal - connects computational linguistics to real-world problem-solving domains. Uses contrast ("Unlike surface-level pattern recognition") to highlight the significance of causal reasoning.

#### Move 2: Establishing Niche (Paragraphs 3-4)
**Content**: Identifies specific gaps in existing causal reasoning benchmarks
**Strengths**:
- Clear gap identification: "suffer from key limitations," "rely on low-fidelity synthetic data," "focus on narrow or biased domains"
- Specific technical challenge: "reduce causality to simplistic cause-effect identification"
- Opposing viewpoint: contrasts synthetic/limited benchmarks with real-world complexity

**Excerpt**: "Despite these advances, the field still lacks a benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs' causal reasoning capabilities. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' causal reasoning suffer from key limitations: they often rely on low-fidelity synthetic data, focus on narrow or biased domains, and reduce causality to simplistic cause-effect identification. As a result, they fail to capture the complexity and diversity of real-world causal reasoning, making it difficult to assess whether LLMs truly reason causally or merely mimic patterns from training data."

**Analysis**: Gap is highly specific and researchable. Uses "Despite these advances" to acknowledge prior work while establishing the niche. Notice the three-part enumeration of limitations (synthetic data, narrow domains, simplistic identification) which creates strong rhetorical structure.

#### Move 3: Occupying Niche (Paragraphs 5-7)
**Content**: Presents benchmark as solution with specific contributions
**Strengths**:
- Clear objectives: "real-world causal relationships verified through rigorous scientific methods"
- Specific outcomes: "29,972 questions after filtering"
- Three-part contribution structure: (1) real-world relationships, (2) broad domain coverage, (3) multi-level evaluation tasks
- Roadmap: outlines paper organization

**Excerpt**: "To bridge this gap, we propose a benchmark grounded in causally identified relationships published in peer-reviewed economics and finance top journals. This benchmark targets a central research question: Can contemporary LLMs understand and reason about complex, scientifically validated causal relationships across diverse real-world domains? To this end, it offers (1) real-world causal relationships verified through rigorous scientific methods rather than synthetic generation, (2) broad domain coverage that extends beyond narrow contexts, and (3) multi-level evaluation tasks designed to distinguish genuine causal reasoning from pattern matching."

**Analysis**: Strong positioning with enumerated contributions. Notice the explicit research question formulation ("Can contemporary LLMs understand...") which clearly defines the scope. Uses three-part structure for clarity and comprehensiveness.

**Excerpt (Methodology Preview)**: "To address these limitations, we construct our benchmark through a systematic pipeline that extracts causally identified relationships from 14,977 papers published between 2000 and 2025 across eight top-tier economics and finance journals. Our approach leverages GPT-5-mini to extract candidate causal relationships from paper abstracts five times, employing clustering and consensus mechanisms to ensure reliability. This process yields 11,869 validated causal relationships spanning diverse economic and financial domains. From these relationships, we generate four distinct task types that progressively test different aspects of causal reasoning—from simple cause-effect identification to complex multi-hop reasoning and directional inference—resulting in a final benchmark of 29,972 questions after filtering out trivially easy items."

**Analysis**: Provides specific methodological details (14,977 papers, 11,869 relationships, 29,972 questions) which establishes credibility through concrete numbers. Uses "systematic pipeline" to emphasize methodological rigor.

#### Key Linguistic Features
- **Nominalization**: "reasoning," "evaluation," "identification" - creates technical formality
- **Passive Voice**: "are extracted," "are generated" - emphasizes processes over agents
- **Technical Terminology**: LLMs, causal inference, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences - assumes expert audience
- **Enumerative Structures**: Frequent use of (1), (2), (3) for clarity and comprehensiveness

### Section 2: Related Work (Literature Review Structure)

#### Move 1: Thematic Overview (Paragraph 1)
**Content**: Broad overview of causal reasoning benchmarks for LLMs
**Strengths**:
- Establishes scope: "causal reasoning benchmarks for LLMs"
- Thematic grouping: evaluation frameworks (CaLM, CausalBench, CLadder), contamination control (CausalProbe-2024)
- Critical positioning: "most benchmarks still emphasize synthetic or LLM-generated tasks"

**Excerpt**: "Causal reasoning benchmarks for LLMs. A growing line of work evaluates whether LLMs move beyond associative pattern-matching toward interventional and counterfactual reasoning (Long et al.; Zečević et al., 2023). CaLM systematizes targets, adaptation regimes, metrics, and error analysis to define a broad design space for causal evaluation (Chen et al., 2024). CausalBench widens the lens across modalities (text, math, code) to probe causal understanding from multiple perspectives (Wang, 2024). CLadder operationalizes Pearl's ladder with natural-language tasks derived from oracle causal engines to directly test associational vs. interventional vs. counterfactual abilities (Jin et al., 2023; Pearl, 2009)."

**Analysis**: Clear positioning relative to existing work. Notice how authors group related work by methodological approach (systematization, multi-modality, Pearl's ladder operationalization).

#### Move 2: Critical Analysis (Paragraphs 2-3)
**Content**: Detailed evaluation of related approaches with emphasis on limitations
**Strengths**:
- Thematic organization: benchmarks, causality extraction, economics/social-science reasoning
- Critical evaluation: "primarily constructed from news, Wikipedia, and other secondary narratives, which are lower-quality and less vetted than peer-reviewed academic papers"
- Comparative analysis: strengths/weaknesses of different approaches
- Explicit positioning: "We introduce a domain-grounded dataset built from peer-reviewed economics/finance articles"

**Excerpt**: "Causality extraction and economics/social-science reasoning. From the IE perspective, the FinCausal shared tasks (2020, 2022) formalized cause–effect detection in financial text (Mariko et al., 2020), while EconLogicQA targets sequential economic logic (Quan and Liu, 2024) and EconNLI casts economic implications as NLI (Guo and Yang, 2024). However, these three benchmarks (FinCausal/EconLogicQA/EconNLI) are primarily constructed from news, Wikipedia, and other secondary narratives, which are lower-quality and less vetted than peer-reviewed academic papers."

**Analysis**: Strong critical analysis with clear limitations identified. Notice how authors group three related benchmarks and critique them collectively for data quality issues. Uses "However" to signal the limitation.

#### Move 3: Research Gaps (Implicit throughout)
**Content**: Gaps emerge through critique of existing work
**Strengths**:
- Gap identification through limitation analysis
- Data quality emphasis: "lower-quality and less vetted than peer-reviewed academic papers"
- Specific technical gaps: synthetic data, narrow domains, lack of verified causal relations

**Excerpt**: "Overall, existing evaluations often rely on synthetic or secondary texts and focus narrowly on simple, direct causal relationships without testing diverse causal directions or analogical reasoning. We introduce a domain-grounded dataset built from peer-reviewed economics/finance articles with explicitly verified causal relations, diverse causal directions, and analogical inference tasks—offering a higher-quality, harder, and more credible test of LLM causal reasoning."

**Analysis**: Literature review concludes by synthesizing limitations and explicitly positioning their contribution. Uses parallel structure ("higher-quality, harder, and more credible") for emphasis.

### Section 3: Benchmark Construction (Methods - Core Technical Contribution)

#### Macro-Level Organization
**Content**: Detailed methodology for benchmark construction
**Strengths**:
- Clear workflow description: two-stage process (extraction, task generation)
- Technical detail: GPT-5-mini extraction, clustering, consensus mechanisms
- Quality assurance: filtering mechanisms, validation procedures
- Task design: four distinct task types with progressive difficulty

**Excerpt (Workflow Overview)**: "The benchmark construction in this study proceeds in two main stages. In the first stage, we extract causal relations in the form of (X, Y, direction) from 8 top-tier economics and finance journals. In the second stage, we generate four distinct task types from these extracted relations."

**Analysis**: Strong methodological section with clear progression from data extraction to task generation. Notice the formal specification of relation format "(X, Y, direction)" which provides precision.

### Section 4: Benchmark Results (Experiments - Evaluation)

#### Macro-Level Organization
**Content**: Comprehensive evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs
**Strengths**:
- Clear evaluation metrics: accuracy, F1 scores across task types
- Model diversity: reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, various scales (8B-70B)
- Detailed results: performance across four task types
- Critical findings: model scale does not guarantee performance

**Excerpt (Main Results)**: "The benchmark results clearly reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate lower-than-expected performance in causal reasoning within economics and finance domains. Qwen3-32B achieved the highest overall accuracy (ALL) at 60.6%, yet this still leaves substantial room for improvement. Notably, model size or recency does not necessarily guarantee performance. GPT-5 recorded one of the lowest accuracies at 30.4%, comparable to GPT-5-mini (38.6%)."

**Analysis**: Strong empirical evaluation with surprising findings (GPT-5 underperformance). Notice the careful language ("lower-than-expected," "notably") which emphasizes the significance of the results without overstating.

**Excerpt (Difficulty Analysis)**: "All models struggled to accurately identify causal relationships even in the Type 1 (X-Y), which contains high-quality, high-context causal statements directly extracted from peer-reviewed social science papers. The average accuracy across all models for X-Y was 41.0%, with F1 scores averaging 26.9%. Surprisingly, even the most advanced reasoning model, GPT-5, achieved merely 29.3% accuracy in this category, underperforming stronger models like Llama-3.3-70B (54.4%), QwQ-32B (58.5%), and Qwen3-32B (71.3%)."

**Analysis**: Detailed performance breakdown with comparative analysis. Uses "Surprisingly" to highlight unexpected findings, and provides specific numerical comparisons to support the claim.

### Section 5: Conclusion

#### Macro-Level Organization
**Content**: Synthesis, contributions, limitations, and future directions
**Strengths**:
- Clear contribution summary
- Balanced limitations discussion (domain specificity, inter-annotator agreement, data contamination)
- Future directions identified
- Broader implications considered

**Excerpt (Contribution Summary)**: "This study introduces a novel benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models' causal reasoning capabilities, constructed from scientifically validated causal relationships extracted from top-tier economics and finance journals. By leveraging peer-reviewed research employing rigorous causal inference methodologies—including instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, and regression discontinuity designs—our benchmark of 29,972 evaluation items spans diverse societal domains including health, environment, technology, legal systems, and culture."

**Excerpt (Key Findings)**: "Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 60.6% overall accuracy. Notably, model scale does not consistently translate to superior performance, and even fundamental causal relationship identification tasks yield an average accuracy of merely 41.0% across models. This poor performance suggests that these models struggle with genuine causal understanding beyond pattern-matching from training data."

**Excerpt (Broader Implications)**: "These findings underscore a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the requirements for reliable causal reasoning in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and policy-making, emphasizing the imperative need to address this capability gap for responsible and effective AI deployment."

**Analysis**: Strong conclusion that restates contributions, synthesizes findings, and connects to broader implications. Notice the progression from specific findings to general implications for AI deployment.
